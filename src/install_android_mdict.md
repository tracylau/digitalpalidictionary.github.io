# Install MDict on Android

MDict on Android has the advantage of instant lookup by **selecting** and **copying** a word. Or if you use DPR, simply by **clicking** any word. 

## In Brief

1. download the latest MDict version of DPD from [Github](https://github.com/digitalpalidictionary/digitalpalidictionary/releases)
2. download and install MDict from [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cn.mdict&hl=en&gl=US) or the [MDict website](https://www.mdict.cn/wp/?page_id=5325&lang=en) 
3. copy DPD to the MDict folder

Below are detailed *anupubba* instructions. 

## Download DPD

First things first, download the latest MDict version of Digital Pāḷi Dictionary from [Github](https://github.com/digitalpalidictionary/digitalpalidictionary/releases)

## Copy the dpd file to the MDict Folder

Using any file manager, make an **MDict/doc** folder on your SD card. \
(That's a folder called **MDict** and a subfolder called **doc**.)

**Copy** dpd.mdx file into the **MDict/doc** folder.

## Setup MDict

You should get this splash screen the first time you run MDict

Open the **Library**.

Check that **DPD** is the library.

Select **Groups > All**. This is important if you want to see **all definitions** of a word.

Open **Settings**.

Click on **Lookup**.

Ensure **Global Clipboard Monitor** is turned on. This allows anything copied to the clipboard to be opened in MDict.

Hold down any Pāḷi word in any text to **select** it, clicking **copy** opens it in MDict.

## DPR Settings

As an added bonus, if you use Digital Pāli Reader, open **Settings** and turn on **Copy words to clipboard on click**. Now simply clicking on any word should open it in MDict.
